## Academy of Py

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, I've finally scratched my idealistic itch and joined the education sector. 
In my latest role, I've become the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 
My responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The final report includes the following:
